# Play Fetch

In this lab, you will use the knowledge you've learned about HTTP requests, asynchronous Javascript (including `Promise`), and `fetch()` to interact with a third-party API and use its results to modify an HTML page.

## Getting Started

Start by going to the GitHub Classroom link provided by your instructor and accept the assignment. For this lab, you may work in your project groups.

Clone the created repository to your computer. You will need to use [**Live Preview**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) or [**Live Server**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for this lab; opening the file directly in your browser may prevent some requests from working.

Open the repository folder in VS Code.

## Submission

Commit **and push** your code back to GitHub.
